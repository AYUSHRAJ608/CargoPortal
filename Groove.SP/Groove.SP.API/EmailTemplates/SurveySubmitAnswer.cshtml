<p>Dear @Model.Name,</p>
<br />
<p>We're hope you're having a lovely day,</p>

<p>If you have a moment to spare, would you be willing to answer a few question here: <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="@Model.Link">@Model.SurveyName</a>?</p>
<p>It will only take you 5 minutes and to show our appreciation.</p>
<br />
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
